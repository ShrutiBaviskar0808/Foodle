# Assets Images Folder

This folder is for storing image assets used in the Rock Stone Identifier app.

## Structure
- Place app logo, icons, and UI images here
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., app_logo.png, stone_placeholder.png)
- Recommended formats: PNG, JPG, WebP

## Usage
Images can be referenced in Flutter code using:
```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/your_image.png')
```

## Guidelines
- Optimize images for mobile (compress before adding)
- Use appropriate resolutions for different screen densities
- Keep file sizes reasonable for app performance
